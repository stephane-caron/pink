    r"""Compute the QP objective function.

    The Hessian matrix :math:`H` and linear vector :math:`c` define the QP
    objective function as:

    .. math::

        \frac{1}{2} \Delta q^T H \Delta q + c^T q

    The configuration displacement :math:`\Delta q` is the output of inverse
    kinematics (we divide it by :math:`\Delta t` to get a commanded velocity).

    Args:
        configuration: Robot configuration to read kinematics from.
        tasks: List of kinematic tasks to fulfill at (weighted) best.
        damping: weight of Tikhonov (everywhere) regularization. Its unit is
            `[cost]^2 / [tangent]` where `[tangent]` is "the" unit of robot
            velocities. Improves numerical stability, but larger values slow
            down all tasks.

    Returns:
        Pair :math:`(H, c)` of Hessian matrix and linear vector of the QP
        objective.

        Our Tikhonov damping is isotropic despite tangent velocities not being
