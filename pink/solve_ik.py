    Compute the Hessian matrix :math:`H` and linear vector :math:`c` of the
    QP objective function:

    .. math::

        \\frac{1}{2} \\Delta q^T H \\Delta q + c^T q

    The configuration displacement :math:`\\Delta q` is the output of inverse
    kinematics (we divide it by :math:`\\Delta t` to get a commanded velocity).

    Args:
        configuration: Robot configuration to read kinematics from.
        tasks: List of kinematic tasks to fulfill at (weighted) best.
        damping: weight of Tikhonov (everywhere) regularization. Its unit is
            `[cost]^2 / [tangent]` where `[tangent]` is "the" unit of robot
            velocities. Improves numerical stability, but larger values slow
            down all tasks.

        objective.

        We trim comparisons to infinity (equivalently: big floats) because some
