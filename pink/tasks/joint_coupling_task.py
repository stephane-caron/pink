class JointCouplingTask(LinearHolonomicTask):
    r"""Coupling between two revolute joints.

    This task enforces a one-dimensional relationship:

    .. math::

        \sum_{j \in J} r_j q_j = 0

    where :math:`J` is a given set of joints the task is configured for,
    :math:`r_j` is the "ratio" associated with a joint :math:`j \in J` and
    :math:`q_j` is the current joint angle (in the configuration vector
    :math:`q`).

    For instance, the humanoid Draco 3 examples uses this task to enforce:

    .. math::

        q_1 - q_2 = 0

    where two joints :math:`J = \{1, 2\}` are coupled to share the same joint
    angle. The ratios are then :math:`r_1 = 1` and :math:`r_2 = -1`.

    This task is a particular case of the more general
    :class:`pink.tasks.linear_holonomic_task.LinearHolonomicTask`.

    Attributes:
        joint_names: a list of joint names consisting of a linear holonomic
            constraint.
        ratios: a list of ratios that each joint takes in a linear holonomic
            constraint.

                holonomic constraint.
            ratios: a list of ratios that each joint takes in a linear
                holonomic constraint.
            cost: value used to cast joint angle differences to a cost, in
                :math:`[\mathrm{cost}] / [\mathrm{rad}]`.
            configuration: Configuration used to retrieve joint indices from
                joint names.
            lm_damping: Unitless scale of the Levenberg-Marquardt (only when
                the error is large) regularization term, which helps when
                targets are unfeasible. Increase this value if the task is too
                jerky under unfeasible targets, but beware that too large a
                damping can slow down the task.
            gain: Task gain :math:`\alpha \in [0, 1]` for additional low-pass
                filtering. Defaults to 1.0 (no filtering) for dead-beat
                control.
