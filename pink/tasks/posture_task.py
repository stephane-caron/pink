    Regulate joint angles to a desired posture, *i.e.* a vector of actuated
    joint angles. Floating base coordinates are not affected by this task.

    Attributes:
        cost: joint angular error cost in
            :math:`[\\mathrm{cost}] / [\\mathrm{rad}]`.
        target_q: Target vector in the configuration space.

    A posture task is typically used for regularization as it has a steady
    rank. For instance, when Upkie's legs are stretched and the Jacobian of its
    contact frames become singular, the posture task will drive the knees
    toward a preferred orientation.
