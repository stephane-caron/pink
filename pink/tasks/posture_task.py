    A posture is a vector of actuated joint angles. Floating base coordinates
    are not affected by this task.

    Attributes:
        target_q: Target vector in the configuration space.

    A posture task is typically used for regularization as it has a steady
    rank. For instance, when Upkie's legs are stretched and the Jacobian of its
    contact frames become singular, the posture task will drive the knees
    toward a preferred orientation.

                damping can slow down the task.
