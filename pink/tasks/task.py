"""All kinematic tasks derive from the :class:`Task` base class.

The formalism used in this implementation is written down in `this note on
task-based inverse kinematics
<https://scaron.info/robotics/inverse-kinematics.html>`_. As of February 2022
it hasn't been updated with the proper dimensional analysis, but the core
concepts and notations are there.

        r"""Compute the task error function.

        The error function :math:`e(q) \in \mathbb{R}^{k}` is the quantity that
        the task aims to drive to zero (:math:`k` is the dimension of the
        task). It appears in the first-order task dynamics:

        .. math::

            J(q) \Delta q = \alpha e(q)

        The Jacobian matrix :math:`J(q) \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times n_v}`,
        with :math:`n_v` the dimension of the robot's tangent space, is
        computed by :func:`Task.compute_jacobian`, while the configuration
        displacement :math:`\\Delta q` is the output of inverse kinematics. The
        error vector :math:`e(q)` is multiplied by the task gain :math:`\alpha
        \in [0, 1]`. The gain is usually 1 for dead-beat control (*i.e.*
        converge as fast as possible), but it can also be lower for some extra
        low-pass filtering.

        Args:
            configuration: Robot configuration :math:`q`.

            Task error vector :math:`e(q)`.

        The weight matrix :math:`W \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times k}` weighs and
        normalizes task coordinates to the same unit. The unit of the overall
        contribution is [cost]^2. The configuration displacement :math:`\Delta
        q` is the output of inverse kinematics (we divide it by :math:`\Delta
