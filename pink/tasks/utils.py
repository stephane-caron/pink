def spatial_minus(Y: pin.SE3, X: pin.SE3) -> np.ndarray:
    r"""Compute the left minus :math:`Y \ominus_0 X`.

    The left minus operator is defined by:

    .. math::

        Y \ominus_0 X = \log(Y \cdot X^{-1})

    This operator allows us to think about orientation "differences" as
    similarly as possible to position differences, but mind the frames! If we
    denote by :math:`Y = T_{0y}` and :math:`X = T_{0x}` the two transforms,
    from respectively frames :math:`y` and :math:`x` to the inertial frame
    :math:`0`, the twist resulting from a left minus is expressed in the
    inertial frame:

    .. math::

        {}_0 \xi_{0x} = Y \ominus_0 X = \log(T_{0y} T_{x0})

    A twist like :math:`{}_0 \xi_{0x}` in the inertial frame is called a
    spatial motion vector.

    Args:
        Y: Transform :math:`Y = T_{0y}` on the left-hand side of the operator.
        X: Transform :math:`X = T_{0x}` on the right-hand side of the operator.

    Returns:
        Spatial motion vector resulting from the difference :math:`\ominus_0`
        between :math:`Y` and :math:`X`.

    Notes:
        The `micro Lie theory <https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01537>`_ describes
        the difference between the left and right minus operators.

def body_minus(Y: pin.SE3, X: pin.SE3) -> np.ndarray:
    r"""Compute the right minus :math:`Y \ominus X`.

    The right minus operator is defined by:

    .. math::

        Y \ominus X = \log(X^{-1} \cdot Y)

    This operator allows us to think about orientation "differences" as
    similarly as possible to position differences, but mind the frames! If we
    denote by :math:`Y = T_{0y}` and :math:`X = T_{0x}` the two transforms,
    from respectively frames :math:`y` and :math:`x` to the inertial frame
    :math:`0`, the twist resulting from a right minus is expressed in the
    local frame :math:`x`:

    .. math::

        {}_x \xi_{0x} = Y \ominus X = \log(T_{x0} T{0y}) = \log(T_{xy})

    A twist like :math:`{}_x \xi_{0x}` in the local frame :math:`x` is called a
    body motion vector.

    Args:
        Y: Transform :math:`Y = T_{0y}` on the left-hand side of the operator.
        X: Transform :math:`X = T_{0x}` on the right-hand side of the operator.

    Returns:
        Body motion vector resulting from the difference :math:`\ominus_0`
        between :math:`Y` and :math:`X`.
