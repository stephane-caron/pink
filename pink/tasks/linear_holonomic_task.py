class LinearHolonomicTask(Task):
    r"""General class for linear holonomic tasks.

    Attributes:
        A: matrix that relates the following relationship:

        .. math::
            e(q) = Aq - b
            \dot{e}(q) := A\dot{q}

        where :math: `e(q) \in \mathbb{R}^{k}` is the quantity that the task 
            aims to derive to zero (:math:`k` is the dimension of the task).
        cost: joint angular error cost in 
            :math:`[\mathrm{cost}] / [\mathrm{rad}]`.

    Note:
        A linear holonomic task is typically used for a robot 
        that has mechanical constraint (e.g., closed loop kinematics).
        Floating base coordinates are not affected by this task.

        The error function :math:`e(q) \in \mathbb{R}^{k}` is the quantity that
        the task aims to drive to zero (:math:`k` is the dimension of the
        task). It appears in the first-order task dynamics:

        .. math::

            J(q) \Delta q = \alpha e(q)

        The Jacobian matrix :math:`J(q) \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times n_v}`,
        with :math:`n_v` the dimension of the robot's tangent space, is
        computed by :func:`Task.compute_jacobian`, while the configuration
        displacement :math:`\\Delta q` is the output of inverse kinematics. The
        error vector :math:`e(q)` is multiplied by the task gain :math:`\alpha
        \in [0, 1]`. The gain is usually 1 for dead-beat control (*i.e.*
        converge as fast as possible), but it can also be lower for some extra
        low-pass filtering.

        Args:

        The weight matrix :math:`W \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}` weighs and
        normalizes task coordinates to the same unit. The unit of the overall
        contribution is :math:`[\mathrm{cost}]^2`. The configuration
        displacement :math:`\Delta q` is the output of inverse kinematics (we
        divide it by :math:`\Delta t` to get a commanded velocity).
