**P**\ ython **in**\ verse **k**\ inematics for articulated robot models, based on `Pinocchio <https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio>`_.

Inverse kinematics in Pink is defined by weighted :ref:`tasks <Tasks>` and :ref:`limits <Limits>`. The library adds a :ref:`configuration <Configuration>` type to Pinocchio, a configuration being a robot model and data to which forward kinematics have been applied. Given a configuration, tasks and a time step, :func:`pink.solve_ik.solve_ik` computes joint velocities that steer the model towards fulfilling all tasks at best.
